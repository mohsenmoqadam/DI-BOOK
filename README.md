## ðŸ“– About DI-BOOK

**DI-BOOK** (Digital Intelligence Book) is a practical and concept-driven journey into how intelligent systems work â€” built from scratch, step by step.  
This book is designed for software engineers who want to deeply understand the logic behind learning algorithms, without relying on heavy math or black-box models.

From basic ideas like gradient descent and error minimization to building actual models in Rust, every chapter aims to transform the way you think about code, intelligence, and systems design.

No buzzwords â€” just clarity, intuition, and code.
